\chapter*{History}
%  These notes were written to my course of Vector Calculus.
 \vspace{1cm}
 
 These notes are based on the \LaTeX\, source of the book ``Multivariable and Vector Calculus'', which has undergone profound changes over time. In particular some examples and figures from   ``Vector Calculus'' by Michael Corral have been added. 
 The tensor part is based on ``Linear algebra via exterior products'' by Sergei Winitzki and on ``Introduction to Tensor Calculus'' by Taha Sochi.

What made possible the creation of these notes was the fact that these four books available are  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.
